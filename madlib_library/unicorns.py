    \
    Unicorns aren't like other {plural_noun1}; \
    they're {adjective1}. They look like \
    {plural_noun_animals}, with {plural_noun2} for feet \
    and a {adjective2} mane of hair. But unicorns \
    are {color1} and have a {adjective3} {noun1} on \
    their heads. Some {plural_noun3} don't \
    believe unicorns are {adjective4} but I \
    believe in them. I would love to {verb1} a \
    unicorn to a faraway {plural_noun4}. One thing \
    I've always {verb_ed1} about is whether \
    unicorns {verb2} rainbows, or is their \
    {noun2} {adjective5} like any other animal's?"
